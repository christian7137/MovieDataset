# Motivation
Last year, there were over 736 new films released just in the United States, and major films cost about 100 million dollars to produce and market. That’s a lot of money! Of course, not every single one of these movies will succeed. We wanted to find out what the keys to success for a film are. To find the answer, we took a dataset of movies and evaluated their success based on revenue and average ratings.
